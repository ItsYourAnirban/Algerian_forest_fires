# Algerian_forest_fires

A self-developed machine learning project to predict forest fire occurrences in two major regions of Algeria ‚Äî Bejaia and Sidi Bel-abbes ‚Äî using weather and environmental data from the summer season of 2012.

## üî• Project Description

This repository contains a binary classification model that predicts whether a forest fire is likely to occur based on meteorological features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and calculated fire weather indices (FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI, FWI).

The model was built **from scratch** using hands-on ML workflows including data preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
