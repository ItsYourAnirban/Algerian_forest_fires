# Algerian_forest_fires

A machine learning project to predict forest fire occurrences in two major regions of Algeria, Bejaia and Sidi Bel-abbes, using meteorological and environmental data collected during the summer of 2012.

## üî• Project Description

This project implements a binary classification model to determine the likelihood of a forest fire based on key weather-related features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and fire weather indices (FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI, FWI).

The pipeline includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training using multiple algorithms, and evaluation using standard classification metrics.
